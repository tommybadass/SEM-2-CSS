            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="red">(Ooh, ooh)</span><br>
                <span class="blue">I, I just woke up from a dream</span><br>
                <span class="red">Where you and I had to say goodbye</span><br>
                <span class="blue">And I don't know what it all means</span><br>
                <span class="red">But since I survived, I realized</span><br>
                <span class="blue">Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow</span><br>
                <span class="red">Nobody's promised tomorrow</span><br>
                <span class="blue">So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night</span><br>
                <span class="red">Like it's the last night</span><br>
                <span class="blue">If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you</span><br>
                <span class="red">If the party was over and our time on Earth was through</span><br>
                <span class="blue">I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile</span><br>
                <span class="red">If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you</span><br>
                <span class="red">(Ooh, ooh)</span><br>
                <span class="blue">Oh, lost, lost in the words that we scream</span><br>
                <span class="red">I don't even wanna do this anymore</span><br>
                <span class="blue">'Cause you already know what you mean to me</span><br>
                <span class="red">And our love's the only war worth fighting for</span><br>
                <span class="blue">Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow</span><br>
                <span class="red">Nobody's promised tomorrow</span><br>
                <span class="blue">So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night</span><br>
                <span class="red">Like it's the last night</span><br>

                <span class="red">If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you</span><br>
                <span class="red">Right next to you</span><br>
                <span class="blue">Next to you</span><br>
                <span class="red">Right next to you</span><br>
                <span class="blue">Oh-oh, oh</span><br>
