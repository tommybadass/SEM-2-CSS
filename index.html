            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>(Ooh, ooh)<br>
            I, I just woke up from a dream<br>
            Where you and I had to say goodbye<br>
            And I don't know what it all means<br>
            But since I survived, I realized<br>
            Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow<br>
            Nobody's promised tomorrow<br>
            So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night<br>
            Like it's the last night<br>
            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
            If the party was over and our time on Earth was through<br>
            I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile<br>
            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
            (Ooh, ooh)<br>
            Oh, lost, lost in the words that we scream<br>
            I don't even wanna do this anymore<br>
            'Cause you already know what you mean to me<br>
            And our love's the only war worth fighting for<br>
            Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow<br>
            Nobody's promised tomorrow<br>
            So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night<br>
            Like it's the last night<br>
            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
            If the party was over and our time on Earth was through<br>
            I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile<br>
            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
            Right next to you<br>
            Next to you<br>
            Right next to you<br>
            Oh-oh, oh<br>
            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
            If the party was over and our time on Earth was through<br>
            I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile<br>
            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
            (Ooh, ooh)<br>
            I'd wanna be next to you</p>
